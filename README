osCommerce Dash Payment Module (based on Bitcoin Payment Module v0.6 https://github.com/weex/oscommerce-bitcoin)

This module enables your osCommerce webstore to accept Dash. 

IMPORTANT: This module is currently under development and works with DASH as the default currency only.


Features:

* Creates a unique payment address for each order
* Automatically updates DASHUSD exchange rate
* Updates order to Processing when payment is received (# of Dash network confirmations is configurable)
* Forwards excess Dash to your off-server forwarding address
* Python script restarts dashd if it becomes unresponsive
* dashd and monitor.py can be run on a server other than the osCommerce hosting server


Requirements:

osCommerce (tested so far only with v2.3.1)
Python with modules: MySQLdb and simplejson
dashd


Installation:

1. Copy all files into your osCommerce installation (the checkout_success.php replaces 
the existing one so if you or any addons have modified that page, you'll want to merge 
our changes).

2. Enable Dash Payment module

3. Fill in dashd RPC host:port, user, password, and create a random notification key

4. Create DASH currency in osCommerce administration -> Localization -> Currencies with 
the following settings. For Value enter # of DASH a USD would buy you.

outside the web root)

6. Copy ./script/default_settings.py to ./script/settings.py and configure at least 
BASE_PATH and OSC_URL

    monitor.py &

You can 'tail -f ./scripts/monitor.log' to follow what the monitor script is doing.
